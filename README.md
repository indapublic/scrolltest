# scrolltest
Illustrated bug with RN scrollview

I need to scroll view to specific element (marked as active in my demo)
It works well in sandbox https://codesandbox.io/s/1q1lq1407 but have some bugs in React-Native
It's reproducible demo for issue https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/22701
